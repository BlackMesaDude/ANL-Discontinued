## What does it offer?

The library main objective is games but it can be extended by implementing new protocols. Also it gives: 

* Generic definitions for the **TCP** and **UDP** protocols
* Packet handling system
* Easy-To-Use multithread system

#### Notes 

```ANL still isn't a complete solution, the developer customization may be required!```
