## How does it offer?

This library base is more aimed towards games but it allows to implement other protocols to enhance the system and your application. It provides a packet identification system for outgoing and incoming packets allowing to define your own from the server to the client side and generics that helps the developer to process them.

### Notes 

```ANL still isn't a complete solution, the developer customization may be required!```
